# Dryland Cropping Performance Forecasting 
Dryland cropping performance prediction based on temporal analysis of Landsat 8 imagery 

This is a repository for an experimental yield forecasting model 

## Background 

Projecting the performance of drland brpadcare cropping in Australia has long been a challange for earth ovservation professions in Australia incluidng the CSIRO. This project aims to provide a scaleable and reproducable model for predicting yield, protien and oil across cereals and canola in Australia. The project will utilise tempotal satelite and weather data and uses a raster-cell level algorithem to itentify drivers of crop performance, befroe being aggregared upto the regional level.
