This project aims to look at what predictive value remote sensing data can add to crop yield forecasting by sourcing imagery over 30-years of to track the relationship between vegetation growth and crop performance from 1989 to 2020. There has been a growing field of academic research on correlating these variables at the paddock, local and small regional level (such as this article: Predicting Wheat Yield at the Field Scale by Combining High-Resolution Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery and Crop Modelling, but not allot that attemps to preduct for large volumes of land cover, such as the larger regional or state level. \n","\n","With open source programming and cloud computing technologies becoming more accessable and powerfull, \n","\n","The model tests a regression analysis approach to using cloud processing of remote sensing data for predicting crop yield at the broad geographical level.\n","\n","To access the data in this blog, and for instructions on how to set up the environment, clone the repository and run the model, visit [the project Github page](https://github.com/mike-petrut/dryland-crop-performance-modelling-project) \n","\n","### Area of Interest\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","#### South Australian Government Land Use Shapefile for Cereals Cropping\n","[](plot00_sa_folium.jpg)\n","\n","## Data Collection & Processing\n","\n","### Google Earth\n","\n","The remote sensing data which is used in this model is sourced from Google Earth Engine (GEE). I have chosen to use this python API due to the speed and potential to process a large volume of imagery in the cloud over the 30-year study period. The code creates 2 collections, Landsat 5 data from 1989 to 1999, and Landsat 7 data from 1999 to 2020. \n","\n","In the repo the custom functions and workflow can be found in earth_engine.py\n","\n","### ABARES \n","\n","The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences publish annual production and area planted data for all states and crops. This is the data I will use as the historical actuals to calculate yield (yield calculated as production / hectares planted). \n","\n","In the repo the workflow for downloading, wrangling and formatting the ABARES data can be found in model_data_setup.py\n","\n","Once the feature extraction and formatting of the raw excel data is complete we can visualize the historical data using the python plotting libraries. \n","\n","\n","#### South Australian Cereal Cropping Production, Area Planted and Average Yield, 1989 -2020\n","![](plot01_sa_historical_1.JPG)\n","\n","![](plot01_sa_historical_2.JPG)\n","\n","## Methodology\n","\n","This model aims to test the relationship between EVI & NDVI values over the key months of August, Spetember and October with final harvest crop yield.
